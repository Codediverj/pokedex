# Pokedex

- This project is for `React` practice.

Project URL : https://codediverj.github.io/pokedex/

## Description
**Goal:** Mini Pokedex App

**Summary:**
Create a Pokedex app. The purpose of the app is to allow the user to search and find details regarding different Pokemon. Use the Pokemon API ([https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)) to help fetch the necessary data.

**Tech Requirements:**

- API: [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)
- Tech Stack:
- Language: **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**
- Framework: **ReactJS** or **NextJS**
- Styling the app can be done in whatever way you're most comfortable with (e.g., **CSS**, **SASS/SCSS**, **TailwindCSS**)
- Use **git** to keep track of your progress with good commit messages throughout development
- Use **GitHub** to keep a repository of your project code

**Feature Requirements:**

- Users should be able to search for a Pokemon (via a search bar) and get a "card" filled with info about that Pokemon. Specifically, the “card” should have at least:
- Name
- Height
- Weight
- Type(s)
- Abilities
- Base Stats (HP/Attack/Defense/Special-Attack/Special-Defense/Speed)
- At least one image/sprite of the Pokemon
- Deploy the app on a static server like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub pages so the link can be visited live

**Bonus Requirements:**

- Make your styling awesome. Try to match the Pokemon type with the style of the card (e.g., red for fire types etc.). Also, try to style the Pokemon's base stats since they are numeric.
- Have a way to display or cycle through all the sprites of that Pokemon, instead of just showing one on the "card".
- Have the app display a few random Pokemon upon loading before the user searches anything.
- Implement auto-complete options for possible Pokemon matches as the user types their query into the search (like Google search bar suggesting results).

When you are done, please send me the following:
